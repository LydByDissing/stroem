The Speaker Cabinet
*******************

The speaker cabinet are constructed from MDF, as this material is well suited for this type of application. Both the low internal damping, as well as the ease of processing, of this material makes it a good choice for constructing speaker cabinets.

To minimize the overall volume of the cabinet, a sealed construction is chosen. Each driver, does in fact, have its own internal cabinet. This is done to minimize the internal interference between the drivers; hence limiting interference artifacts.

Cabinet construction
====================

To ensure an easy assembly of the speaker cabinet, a sandwish construction is used. This makes it easy to construct the different layers and at the same time, simplyfing the construction of this semi complex cabinet. This also makes it possible to machine all the individual layers on a CNC.
This comes in handy when utilizing `decentrilized manufactoring <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_manufacturing>`_.
