Full Range Driver
*****************

.. warning:: This is a required part!

  The driver, the cabinet and the amplifier are all tuned together. Changing one, changes the tuning and thereby the sound and acoustical performance.
  This means that a different make and/or model driver can't be used in this speaker.
