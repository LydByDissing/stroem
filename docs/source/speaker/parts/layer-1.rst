Part description
----------------
This is the bottom layer of the cabinet. Here speaker wire cable tracks are cut into the materiel.
To make room for the DC barrel power plug, a large keyhole slot is cutout.

In the middle of the part a single circle is cutout to indicate the layer number. One circle equals layer 1.

The four small holes (Ø3,5mm) -- one in each corner -- are used when mounting the back plate to the main cabinet. The three larger holes (Ø6mm) are using for aligning the three layers during cabinet assembly.
