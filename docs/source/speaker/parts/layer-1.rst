Part description
----------------

This is the first layer of the cabinet, connecting directly to the baffle.
To make room for the DC barrel power plug and it's wires, a mounting hole and a tapering slot are cut. This helps guide the DC power cables from the DC socket.

In the middle of the part a single circle is cutout to indicate the layer number. One circle equals layer 1.

The three larger holes (Ã˜8,5mm) are for dowels, used for aligning the three layers during cabinet assembly.
