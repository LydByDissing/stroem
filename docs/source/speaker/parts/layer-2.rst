Part description
----------------

This is the middle layer of the cabinet. To make room for the DC barrel power socket, a matching DC socket mounting hole is cutout. Half of this hole are counter sunk at a wider diameter (Ø11,5) to accommodate for the wider diameter of the DC plug itself - to ensure that this plugin can be fully consealed within the cabinet (for on wall placement).

The small holes (Ø2mm) are used when mounting the back plate to the main cabinet.
The larger holes (Ø8,4mm) are for dowels, used for aligning the three layers during cabinet assembly.
