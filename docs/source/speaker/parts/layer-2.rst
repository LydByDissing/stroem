Part description
----------------
This is the middle layer of the cabinet. To make room for the DC barrel power socket, a matching slot is cutout. this is done so the socket is counter sunk into the materiel.

In the middle of the part a couple of circles are cutout to indicate the layer number. Two circles equals layer 2.

The four small holes (Ø3,5mm) -- one in each corner -- are used when mounting the back plate to the main cabinet. Depending on the length on the screws used when mounting the back panel, these holes need to be bored.
The three larger holes (Ø6mm) are using for aligning the three layers during cabinet assembly.
