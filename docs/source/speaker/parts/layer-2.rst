Part description
----------------

This is the middle layer of the cabinet. To make room for the DC barrel power socket, a matching DC socket mounting hole is cutout. Half of this hole are counter sunk at a wider diameter (Ø11,5) to accommodate for the wider diameter of the DC plug itself - to ensure that this plugin can be fully consealed within the cabinet (for on wall placement).

In the middle of the part a couple of circles are cutout to indicate the layer number. Two circles equals layer 2.

The three larger holes (Ø8,5mm) are for dowels, used for aligning the three layers during cabinet assembly.
