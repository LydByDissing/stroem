Part description
----------------
This is the third layer of the cabinet. A long DC power cable track are cut into this layers. This helps route the wires from the DC socket to the PCB; which is placed in the upper left compartment.

In the middle of the part a couple of circles are cutout to indicate the layer number. Three circles equals layer 3.

The four small holes (Ø3,5mm) -- one in each corner -- are used when mounting the back plate to the main cabinet. Depending on the length on the screws used when mounting the back panel, these holes need to be bored

.. note::

	The back panel mounting holes can likely be omitted in this part, as the back panel mounting screws are unlikely to reach this far into the cabinet.

The three larger holes (Ø6mm) are using for aligning the three layers during cabinet assembly.
