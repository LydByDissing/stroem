Part description
----------------

This part helps support the baffle and stiffen the cabinet.
As the drivers are very close together the baffle becomes rather thin and will therefore benefit from being reenforced.

It is also used to ensure proper fixation of the wall mounting bracket.

This part is needed in a sub assembly.
