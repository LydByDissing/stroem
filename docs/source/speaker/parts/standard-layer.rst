The cabinet back panel are the bottom layer in the complete cabinet. This part makes an air tight fit to the rest of the cabinet, sealing the enclosure.

Four counter sunk screw holes -- one in each corner -- are created in this part for easy assembly.

To ensure a close distance between the back panel and the wall, when wall mounted, a bracket needs to be recessed into this part. This bracket must be fastened with two wood screws.
