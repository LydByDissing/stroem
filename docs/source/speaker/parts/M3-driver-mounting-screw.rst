Parts Description
-----------------
To ensure proper mounting of the speaker drivers, it's not enough to just drive the screws into the MDF of the baffle. We need mounting hardware to ensure that the drivers remain in place. A set of :ref:`Drive-in nuts <drive-in nuts>` are mounted on the backside of the :ref:`baffle <cabinet baffle>`. These screws are fasted into the nuts, holding the drivers in place.
