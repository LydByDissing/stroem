Part description
----------------
The baffle are where the speaker drivers are mounted. They are counting sunk into the baffle, so the top of the driver matches the top of the baffle.
For each driver four screw holes are made to fasten the driver to the baffle.

Three assembly-guiding holes are also cut in to the baffle. This helps aligning the different layers with each other.
