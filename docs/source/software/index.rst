The Software Platform
*********************

This speaker is capable of playing audio through :ref:`Bluetooth <bluetooth>` and :ref:`Spotify Connect <spotify-connect>`, as well as other sources.
All of this are handled by the software platform called `Euphonium <https://github.com/feelfreelinux/euphonium>`_. This is a separate project on GitHub and it can be used for other types of platforms. Not just this ESP32 based setup. Read more in this projects documentation.
