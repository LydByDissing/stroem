## Project description and Design Goals
As mentioned above, this project aims at designing a **wifi speaker**, capable of streaming audio using **Bluetooth** and **Spotify Connect**.

The primary design goals of the _Strøm_ speaker are:

* Minimalistic design language
* Playback via Spotify Connect and Bluetooth
* Wall mountable
* Sustainable materials
* Open Source

Making it a modern, minimalistic and fully capable speaker. Further requirement details can be found in the [requirements document](https://stroem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirements.html).

Besides making a modern and capable wifi speaker we are also aiming at validating the concept of "local manufactoring" - how we exactly are going to succeed with this are still an unanswered questions; see [issue #5](https://wikifactory.com/+opennext/lydbydissing/issues/local-production-but-how) for further discussions on the matter.

## Open Next Demonstrator
This project takes part in Open Next 2022 as a demonstrator project - one of twelve to be exact.
Most Strøm and Open Next communication will happen over at [this](https://wikifactory.com/@sidsel/osd-platform-for-maker) page.
